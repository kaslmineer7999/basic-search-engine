# basic-search-engine

## how it works
its simply a HTML form that sends your query into a

bash CGI (not to be confused with Computer-generated imagery) script

that would search a text database contanied in `document root/db.txt` for the search term.

## sample database
a sample database should look like this:
```
example|http://example.com
google|http://google.com
youtube|http://youtube.com
facebook|http://facebook.com
tiktok|http://tiktok.com
pornhub|http://pornhub.com
```
